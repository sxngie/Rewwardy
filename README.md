# Project Webpage

### [This link](https://rewwardy-capstone.web.app/about) is to access the project webpage, where one can run the project without downloads nor local hosting.
Said link redirects to the project's About page, where one can find: 
- Elevator Pitch Video
- Presentation Slides
- Admin Login
- User Login

In order to proceed, the recommended route is the following:

### Start:
- Access the [Admin Login](https://rewwardy-capstone.web.app/admin) and click "Create an Account".
- Once in the page, fill the information necessary to create an account.
- Proceed to login as an Admin.
- Click the "Create a Reward" button.
- Fill the information to create a reward (note: For best user experience, upload your images first. Ensure your image is a.jpg or .png file!)
- Once that is set up, navigate to the QR Code page using the hamburger menu on the top right corner.
- Take a picture on your mobile device of the QR code (or print it out at home, whichever you prefer!)
  
### Next steps:
- Open the [User Login](https://rewwardy-capstone.web.app/) (preferrably in a different tab-- It will be helpful later!) and click "Create an Account" (or Sign in with Google!).
- Once in the page, fill the information necessary to create an account.
- Proceed to login as a User.
- Navigate to the QR Scanner page using the hamburger menu on the top right corner.
- Use previously acquired QR code from the Admin side (be it on paper or a mobile device), and align it in view of the camera.
- Press the "Redeem" button! (This will now redirect you to the User Dashboard and give you access to view the Challenge you created on the Admin side.)
  
### Start Earning:
- Scroll to the bottom of the Dashboard and click "More Info" on your Challenge. (You will be able to view your progress towards the reward, description, and valid until date.)
- Interested in earning this reward? Click the "Track" button to flag it and move it towards In-Progress. (This will redirect you to the Dashboard again, to view the In-Progress Reward card.)

### Logging Progress towards a Reward:
- Once again, navigate towards the QR Scanner page and scan the QR code again.
- On the open Admin Dashboard tab, refresh the Dashboard to view the statistics reflect the number of scans.
- Proceed to loop the previous two steps until you meet the required visit amount for your reward.

### Redeeming a Reward 
- Once you have met the required visit amount, click the "View Progress" button on the In Progress reward card.
- Click the "Redeem" button to redeem the reward. (This will redirect you to the Dashboard page, where you will be able to view the Reward card in the Rewards Available section.)
- Click the "Redeem" button on the Reward Available card.
- Copy the Reward code available.

### Awarding Recipient
- On the Admin Dashboard tab, navigate towards "Search for Rewards".
- Once there, paste the code provided from the User Reward and click the "Search" button.
- Validate the status for the reward is "available". If so, click the "Award Recipient" button. (This will refresh the page.)
- You can paste the code again and click the "Search" button to be able to validate the reward status updated to "redeemed".
- On the User tab, navigate to the Rewards page using the Hamburger Menu. Click "Redeem" on the reward: you will be able to view your reward status updated to "redeemed".
- On the Admin tab, navigate towards the Dashboard and view the updated statistics. 

Happy Rewwarding! :) 



# Getting Started to Run Locally

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
